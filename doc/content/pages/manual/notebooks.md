title: Working with Jupyter notebooks


Jupyter Notebooks allow you to mix code, output, and text. Notebooks are enormously popular for data analysis. Notebooks are generally edited in a browser, using the JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook browser apps. The downside of this workflow is that these browser apps do not (yet) support all of the features of a modern code editor. Therefore, Rapunzel allows you to import and export Jupyter Notebooks, so that you can develop your notebooks on the desktop, while still being able to publish them on the web.

When you import a notebook (`.ipynb` files), you get a regular Python script, in which code and Markdown cells are defined as described under [Running code](%url:running%). When you export this script, a notebook file is generated, which you can subsequently open and execute in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
